# Token Aura Ring

A simple module for Foundry VTT which adds an outlined ring aura to a token.

## About

This Foundry VTT module allows you to add and customise an outlined ring aura around a token.

Ideal for cleanly representing the range of an effect without obscuring the map with a solid fill or lighting effect.

Inspired by the [Token Auras](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/token-auras) add-on.

## Installation

Either search for and install this module within Foundry VTT, or copy this address into the `Manifest URL` bar:

```

```

## Usage

Once enabled, you can add and configure aura rings from the "Aura Ring" tab on any Token's setting page.

From there you can set the radius, colour, weight, and style of the aura ring.

To remove an aura ring, press the "Clear" button on the settings page.

## Issues

This module may not work with game systems or addons which already implement their own token auras.

If you encounter any problems, raise a ticket on Github and I'll take a look.
